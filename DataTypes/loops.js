//A loop usually has one or more of the following features:

//A counter, which is initialized with a certain value 
//this is the starting point of the loop

//An exit condition, which is the criteria under which the loop stops â€”
// usually the counter reaching a certain value. 

//An iterator, which generally increments the counter by a small amount on each successive loop
// until it reaches the exit condition.

//Visual Basic loop structures allow you to run one or more lines of code repetitively. 
//You can repeat the statements in a loop structure until a condition is True, until a condition is False,
// a specified number of times, or once for each element in a collection.

// Question 1 Create a loop that says 'Hi' 5 times
    // Hi!
    // Hi!
    // Hi!
    // Hi!
    // Hi!
//for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
//    console.log('Hi')

//Create a loop which tells us what loop number it is on
 
    // The variable "let i =0" means the variable is starting at the 0 index
    // The word let replaces (var) and the the index = 0, which is less than 5
    //
    //**For Loop Comment**
    // We arecreating a loop. First We are declaring a variable called i.
    // Then we are setting the maximum value of i.
    // Then we are saying that we'd like i to increase by.
    
    //for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    //    console.log(i + 1);
 
    // Create a loop which tells us what loop number it is on
    // - The CLI should look as follows:
